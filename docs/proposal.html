<h1 align="middle">CS184 Final Project</h1>
    <h2 align="middle">Proposal</h2>
    	<h3 align="middle">GPU path tracer using NVIDIA OptiX</h3>
<p align="middle">
Our project will aim to implement a raytracer but backed by GPU power using NVIDIA OptiX. We plan to implement all the same features found in project 3-1 and 3-2 such as BVH, importance sampling, adaptive sampling, mirror glass and microfacet materials, and depth of field. Time permitting we will extend our raytracer to include difficult materials such as cloth.

<h3 align="middle"> Problem Description </h3>
<p align="middle">
Recent advances in GPU power have made a lot of applications of computer science faster. One of these is ray tracing and rendering in general. After impatiently waiting for project 3 images to render, we ask ourselves: how do we make this faster? We plan to port the whole project including the backend to use OptiX, which requires a deeper understanding of raytracing than required to complete the project. 
</p>
<h3 align="middle"> Goals and Deliverables </h3>
<h5 align="middle"> Plan to Deliver </h5>
<p align="middle">
The images from Project 3-1 Part 3 along with Project 3-2 Parts 1, 2, & 4. <br>
Timing data showing time to render scenes with and without GPU as the mesh complexity scales. 
</p>
<h5 align="middle"> Hope to Deliver </h5>
<p align="middle">
Timing showing GPU speedup with various effects and BSDF's. An image with a realistic cloth BSDF also sped up by our Optix ray tracer. Potentially even a set of starter code so that future versions of this class can use a GPU path tracer and people won't have to rely on hive machines. 
</p>

<h3 align="middle">  Schedule </h3>
<p align="middle">
Week1: Transfer backend to our best ability to OptiX, load dae/sky/CBspheres_lambertian.dae and produce the simplest Cornell box probably as a mesh.  <br>

Week2: Get BVH working, global illumination. We should have all of Project 3-1 by now.  <br>

Week3: Add mirror, glass, and microfacet materials. Implement depth of field.  <br>

Week4: Timing experiments, writeup, cloth material time permitting.    <br>
</p>

<h3 align="middle">  Resources </h3>
<p align="middle">
The OptiX SDK comes with a set of examples. Nvidia also has a developer forum which is a good place to look.
